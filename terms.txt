As federal guidelines expire some states press ahead to reopen despite health warnings
As some states moved to reopen Friday  while others kept residents home to curb the outbreak  America is finding itself divided in new ways not just by politics and geography but by public health policy the toll of the pandemic and where people can dine in restaurants or get haircuts in barber shops

Millions more Americans will soon be able to eat at restaurants and shop in stores as some states moved toward reopening on Thursday despite warnings from public health experts

Governors in several states  including Alabama Maine Tennessee and Texas  plan to allow stay-at-home orders to expire on Thursday paving the way for certain businesses to reopen and marking the end of an unparalleled month in which an astonishing nine in  residents in the United States were told to stay at home to help stop the spread of the virus

Federal guidelines encouraging people to curtail nearly all public activities are also poised to expire Thursday after President Trump indicated he did not intend to extend them

The latest reopenings represent a pivotal moment in Americas response to the virus even as the number of deaths from the virus in the United States has surged past  As of Friday more than a dozen states will have begun to partially reopen their economies and restart public life raising concerns among health experts about another spike in cases that may not be detected in official numbers for two weeks

Dr Anthony S Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has warned that premature action by states could lead to a rebound to get us right back in the same boat that we were in a few weeks ago

Texas is expected to take one of the most expansive actions on Friday allowing retail stores restaurants movie theaters and malls to reopen and operate at  percent capacity Gov Greg Abbott a Republican lifted his stay at home order after less than a month citing the states expanded testing stock of protective equipment and a high number of coronavirus recoveries

Other states opted to open just one major sector of the economy at a time Gov Kay Ivey of Alabama a Republican will allow many retail stores to reopen Thursday night In Maine Gov Janet Mills a Democrat will allow barber shops hair salons and pet groomers to reopen starting Friday

The pace of reopening has created a divided America along both political and geographical lines Many states in the South with Republican governors were among the first to partially reopen including Georgia Oklahoma and South Carolina which paved the way last week Also beginning to reopen are less dense states including Alaska and Montana

Several of the nations most populous states remain on extended lockdown including California New York Illinois and Michigan where hundreds of protesters gathered at the Capitol in Lansing on Thursday to urge lawmakers to vote against extending the state of emergency

After pictures of packed California beaches led to an outcry that social distancing guidelines were being flagrantly flouted  Gov Gavin Newsom of California said Thursday that beaches in Orange County south of Los Angeles were ordered closed

We are going to do a hard close in that part of the state just in the Orange County area he said while praising the behavior of beachgoers elsewhere

The decision followed pleas by Mr Newsom to slow the spread of the virus by staying home despite the temptations of seawater and sunny weather Photographs of umbrellas and surfers dotting the shoreline of some beaches showed that many residents had not heeded his requests

Mr Newsom said the beach shutdown in Orange County was a temporary closure adding I hope its a very short term adjustment

State parks will remain open as long as we are modifying our behavior and practicing the physical distancing he said

Nathan Click a spokesman for Mr Newsom said the closures in Orange County were effective on Friday The order applies to both state and local beaches Mr Click said

Beaches in warmer parts of the nation have emerged as flash points for weeks as photos showing social distancing guidelines being recklessly flouted Photos of crowded beaches in Florida during spring break prompted national outrage

Now as spring brings warmer weather all over beaches are posing a challenge to more coastal states Many are struggling to find a balance that will allow them to provide safe outdoor spaces to a frustrated pent-up public while preventing the kind of large packed gatherings that can help spread the virus  but which are commonly found on big public beaches

Even as California ordered some beaches closed other states were reopening their own

Beaches in Alabama were set to reopen Thursday afternoon under Gov Kay Iveys new safer-at-home order which limits gatherings to fewer than  people and requires six feet of distance between groups from different households Beaches in Galveston Texas will reopen on Friday  following Gov Greg Abbotts phased reopening order which permits outdoor activities as long as people tale precautions to minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household

Municipal authorities in Orange County where the beach issue has been most contentious said earlier that they had seen a notification from the California Police Chiefs Association which said it was offering a heads up to local law enforcement to provide time for you to plan for any situations you might expect as a result knowing each community has its own dynamics

Earlier this week the City Council in Newport Beach which is in Orange County voted down a measure that would have closed the beaches during the next three weekends Instead it asked for more police officers and lifeguards to patrol the beaches and enforce social distancing

Even before the state began considering closing beaches the flurry of beachgoers last weekend prompted some local governments to take action

In Northern California Santa Cruz County on Wednesday said it was closing beaches entirely between the hours of  am and  pm beginning this weekend and that they would only be open for recreational activities to promote physical and mental health outside of that window Officials there said the order was a direct result of the overwhelming weekend beach crowds

Despite warnings against traveling to Santa Cruz County for beach access and against congregating on beaches local law enforcement spent the weekend responding to numerous issues all along our coastline Sheriff Jim Hart of Santa Cruz County said in a statement Unfortunately these actions are necessary to protect the health and welfare of our most vulnerable residents

A Newport Beach spokesman John Pope said a statewide closure wouldnt be difficult to enforce but that it could inflame divisions among conservative civil libertarians and residents who fear further spread of the virus There are passionate arguments on both sides he said and this is going to get very political very fast

If anything the job losses may be far worse than government figures indicate according to many economists A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that roughly  percent more people than counted as filing claims in a recent four-week period may have qualified for benefits but were stymied in applying or didnt even try because they found the process too formidable

As Emily Badger and Alicia Parlapiano reported systems that were devised to treat each unemployment case as potentially fraudulent are now rushing to deal with millions of newly unemployed people

The state unemployment systems that were supposed to help millions of jobless workers were full of boxes to check and mandates to meet that couldnt possibly apply in a pandemic

States required workers to document their job searches weekly to register with employment services in person to take a wait period before their first check up to  days

Such requirements increased in the years following the Great Recession as many states moved to tighten access to or reduce unemployment benefits With them most states cut the share of jobless workers they helped

Gilead plans to give away the first  million doses of remdesivir if the FDA grants approval

Gilead Sciences plans to give away the first  million doses of remdesivir an antiviral drug shown to modestly reduce recovery time in virus patients if the Food and Drug Administration grants emergency approval

Gilead could charge for the drug under a so-called emergency use authorization from the agency But at least at the beginning Gilead will provide the drug free of charge Dan ODay the companys chief executive said in an interview on Thursday

The company started planning in January to manufacture remdesivir in large quantities well before large federal trial of the antiviral drug began at the end of February

The results announced by administration officials on Wednesday showed that patients receiving the drug recovered in  days on average compared to  days for patients receiving a placebo

Dr  Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the results were a very important proof of concept but not a knockout

Gilead has about  million vials of remdesivir on hand enough to treat  to  patients with a ten-day course Mr ODay said Gilead should have enough to treat  patients by the fall and one million by December he added

Gilead has not decided yet on whether or what to charge for the drug in the long run Mr ODay said

Gilead has a controversial history with drug pricing noted Harvard health care economist Aaron Kesselheim

The company bought a drug that cured hepatitis C from a small company and then charged so much for it -  for a pill which translated into  for a course of treatment  that many state Medicaid programs and prison systems could not afford it

A lot of people with hepatitis C did not get the drug early on Dr Kesselheim said And this was a drug unlike remdesivir that was a curative treatment for an otherwise chronic and deadly disease

Dr Kesselheim said pricing for remdesivir should take into account a large public investment in the drug It was developed and tested by scientists at Vanderbilt University and Emory University among other institutions and the federal trial was taxpayer-funded he noted

Earlier on Thursday Dr Fauci said that he was optimistic a vaccine could be available in large quantities as early as January

Vice President Mike Pence was photographed wearing a face mask for the first time on Thursday during a visit to a General Motors plant in Indiana

Mr Pence was criticized earlier this week for flouting the guidelines of the Mayo Clinic that asked for all visitors to wear face masks Surrounded by administration officials and medical professionals wearing masks Mr Pence appeared to be the only person at the clinic who was not covering his face

At the time Mr Pence defended himself saying he was tested regularly for the coronavirus so there was no need for him to wear a face mask because he was not at risk of contributing to asymptomatic spread an argument that experts immediately dismissed as faulty But in his first public outing since then Mr Pence appeared to concede to public pressure and covered his face

The vice president visited a General Motors plant in his home state that had been converted into a ventilator production site He participated in a round-table discussion with employees there

Its amazing to think this floor was empty about a month ago Mr Pence said It was a partnership to meet a vital need for Americans struggling in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic

TRANSCRIPT


Lets Make Sure That Were Doing Everything We Can Cuomo Says
Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York provided details about how New York City subways and buses will be disinfected each day
You now have fewer MTA workers you have fewer NYPD workers on the trains and in the stations We have now a greater need than ever to disinfect the subways the buses and the stations You want to honor the essential workers  Thank you thank you thank you Well fly airplanes Well have public demonstrations of gratitude Yeah even better than that is what you do and how you act And lets make sure that were doing everything we can Lets clean disinfect those trucks those buses and trains every  hours I challenged the MTA to come up with a plan They came up with a plan They can disinfect all trains and buses every night It can best be done by stopping train service from  am to  am every night during the pandemic so they can actually perform this service

Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York said Thursday that the New York City subway would halt service from  am to  am each night so trains could be disinfected

The policy will go into effect next Wednesday May  the governor said Public transit in New York City is the only system in the United States and among the relatively few in the world that runs  hours a day The system has only shut down twice in the past decade both times as a result of hurricanes including Sandy in 

This is as ambitious as anything weve ever undertaken the governor said

He said that shuttle buses dollar vans and even for-hire vehicles would provide what he called an essential connector during those hours to transport essential workers who needed to get to their jobs

The announcement comes after days of building tension over homeless people using subway trains as an alternative form of shelter and creating what many felt were unsanitary conditions on trains On Tuesday Mr Cuomo who effectively controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority the state agency that runs the transit system had declared the situation disgusting

The governor said Thursday that Mayor Bill de Blasio would help lead the effort to coordinate transportation during the nightly halt and praised the mayor for his cooperation

Its a heck of an undertaking by the mayor and I applaud him for his ambition here in stepping up and taking this on Mr Cuomo said

Mr de Blasio appearing at Mr Cuomos briefing via video said that the effort would be a way to help homeless people whose life on the subways he called an unacceptable reality

The MTA had rolled out new measures to address the use of the subway by the homeless on Wednesday

Here are some other highlights from the governors morning briefing

 more people died of the virus in the state the lowest daily death toll since March 

The number of new hospital admissions for virus patients declined after it ticked up slightly on Wednesday

The number of virus patients in hospitals dropped for the th day in a row and is now below   down nearly  percent from mid-April when there were nearly  hospitalized patients

Mr Cuomo also gave more details on the states planned effort to test and trace saying that the massive effort would require hiring between  and  contact tracers depending on the viruss spread

When social distancing is relaxed contract tracing is our best hope for isolating the virus when it appears and keeping it isolated said Michael R Bloomberg the former mayor of New York City who appeared by video at the governors briefing and who has volunteered to lead the effort

Also on Thursday Mr Trump met with Gov Philip D Murphy of New Jersey where the death toll is mounting The president stopped short of offering more money even as Mr Murphy said his state would need between  billion and  billion in assistance for a full economic recovery

It was the presidents third Oval Office sit-down with a governor this week as he begins to turn his focus to helping states reopen their economies

On Wednesday New Jersey reported that  more people had died of the virus virtually equaling the same days daily toll in New York The number of deaths was striking given that New Jersey has less than half the population of New York

Theres no evidence that drugs championed by Trump help virus patients researchers say
A report from Harvard researchers adds to the growing doubts about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the malaria drugs that Mr Trump has repeatedly advocated for virus patients

The drugs should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits the researchers wrote in an article posted Thursday in The Faseb Journal published by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology

The authors found evidence that the drugs could harm Covid patients but no evidence that they could help in an analysis of  published studies

The drugs can cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm especially in high doses or when combined with the antibiotic azithromycin  which some doctors have recommended  or with other drugs that may also disrupt heart rhythm

The Food and Drug Administration issued a similar warning last week as did the agency led by Dr Anthony Fauci the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Trump officials are said to have pushed spies to hunt for unproven links between the virus and a lab in Wuhan

Senior Trump administration officials have pushed American spy agencies to hunt for evidence to support an unsubstantiated theory that a government laboratory in Wuhan China was the origin of the outbreak according to current and former American officials The effort comes as Mr Trump escalates a public campaign to blame China for the pandemic

Some intelligence analysts are concerned that the pressure from administration officials will distort assessments about the virus and that they could be used as a political weapon in an intensifying battle with Beijing over the outbreak that has infected more than three million people across the globe

Most intelligence agencies remain skeptical that conclusive evidence of a link to a lab can be found and scientists who have studied the genetics of the coronavirus say that the overwhelming probability is that it leapt from animal to human in a nonlaboratory setting as was the case with HIV Ebola and SARS

Reporting for The New York Times Mark Mazzetti Julian E Barnes Edward Wong and Adam Goldman investigate how scientists spies and government officials have wrestled for months with varying theories about how the outbreak began Many agree on the importance of determining the genesis of the pandemic In government and academia however experts have ruled out the notion that it was concocted as a bioweapon And they agree that the new pathogen began as a bat virus that evolved naturally probably in another mammal to become adept at infecting and killing humans

A few veteran national security experts have pointed to a history of lab accidents infecting researchers to suggest it might have happened in this case but many scientists have dismissed such theories

Macys one of the biggest department store chains in the United States announced an ambitious plan on Thursday to reopen all of its  locations including Bloomingdales and Bluemercury in the next six to eight weeks the latest sign of how eager the nations largest retailers are to return to business

The reopening plan will start on Monday with  stores in Georgia Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee and Texas and another  locations on May  Macys said it would reopen stores only in markets where state and local governments said it was safe for nonessential retailers to return to business The chain temporarily closed its stores on March  causing the majority of its sales to disappear and furloughed the majority of its  employees in the past month

Macys expects that its reopened stores will only bring in about  to  percent of their typical business at first and slowly build from there the companys chief executive Jeff Gennette said during a presentation He acknowledged that it was an open question as to whether shoppers would return

There will be new protocols for fitting rooms and beauty counters associates will wear company-issued cloth masks and sometimes gloves hand sanitizer stations will be placed by elevators and escalators and plexiglass barriers will be installed at cash registers

Top Army leaders on Thursday defended their decision to summon  cadets back to West Point in June for a graduation ceremony featuring a speech by the president The students would have to return anyway to take physical exams pack their belongings and move out of their barracks they said

They have to come back to the academy to begin the process to become second lieutenants and report to their first assignments Ryan McCarthy the Army secretary told reporters in a conference call

Mr Trump and the academy have been criticized since he abruptly announced on April  that he would be speaking at West Point the only major service academy he had not yet addressed Students had left campus in early March as the outbreak in New York State intensified

After postponing its graduation ceremony the academy had been looking at the option of a delayed presidential commencement in June but had yet to finalize any plans Mr Trumps pre-emptive statement later confirmed by the Pentagon meant recalling  cadets scattered across the country

The West Point superintendent said on Thursday that returning seniors would be screened tested and quarantined for  days before graduation Ample medical supplies and personnel were on hand he said adding weve created a safety bubble

Other service academies have done things differently The Naval Academy decided it was too risky to bring back its nearly  graduating midshipmen to Annapolis Md for commencement opting for a virtual event The Air Force Academy sent home its underclassmen locked down its seniors on campus moved up graduation mandated social distancing  and went ahead with plans for the vice president to be its speaker on April

Oprah Winfrey will headline a virtual commencement ceremony in Chicago
Chicago has a workaround for its more than  graduating seniors stuck at home a virtual commencement ceremony featuring Oprah Winfrey

The ceremony details of which are still being worked out will take place in mid-June It will include performances speeches and a keynote address by Ms Winfrey who lives and works in the city In addition to graduating seniors from Chicagos public high schools students from local private and religious schools will also be included

The planned event is one of the first of its kind to be announced as states and cities continue to grapple with widespread school and business closures as they try to contain the viruss spread In states like Illinois where the illnesss outbreak and death toll has been relatively high state officials have said that schools will remain closed through the end of the current academic year

In an interview Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago said that its been a difficult period for the citys students whose studies and post-graduation plans were affected by a teachers strike that was followed a few months later by the March school closures

Given everything I feel we owe our seniors a proper sendoff she said

The mayor said she had recently convened a working group to discuss the ceremonys details including officials from a variety of area schools Some of the ideas currently under discussion are mentioning individual student accolades and carrying a livestream of the names of all the graduating seniors on the web and on social media Ms Lightfoot who plans to announce the virtual commencement plan at her regularly scheduled press briefing on Thursday is hoping to convince a local television news outlet to carry the event live

Help is also being provided by the large trading firm and hedge-fund company Citadel which is based in downtown Chicago Citadel will provide both financing and production assistance according to Ms Lightfoot and a Citadel spokesman Ms Winfrey wont be paid for her remarks

The pandemic has hit small and independent restaurants hard forcing owners to shutter dining rooms and lay off employees But the shutdowns have done more than imperil the restaurants financial health  they have made the buildings themselves tempting targets for burglars emboldened by the quiet streets and deserted spaces

Across the country closed restaurants have been invaded by thieves who seem especially drawn to well-stocked liquor cabinets and iPads and other equipment

Its the perfect storm said Kam Razavi an owner of a California restaurant who watched from his phone as security cameras recorded a burglar helping himself to the best bottles in the bar They know everybody is probably at home with a loaded gun Theyre not going to go rob homes Theyre going to go to closed businesses

When his restaurant was broken into in early April Mr Razavi had already laid off most of his  or so employees and was uncertain whether he would ever reopen Now he is out  from stolen alcohol a broken door and cleanup costs

Most restaurant owners who have had burglaries expect their insurance companies to cover at least a portion of the damage though the pandemic has created backlogs for claims delaying payments in some cases

Some burglars havent gotten far Shortly after the lockdown in New York a would-be thief broke into Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Harlem and put a few half-empty bottles of alcohol into a bag When he came upstairs from the basement police officers were waiting for him

This is a difficult question because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained A better question might be How will we know when to reopen the country In an American Enterprise Institute report Scott Gottlieb Caitlin Rivers Mark B McClellan Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least  days

How can I help
The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected which accepts donations here Charity Navigator which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak You can give blood through the American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities More than  coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal though

Should I wear a mask
The CDC has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms Until now the CDC like the WHO has advised that ordinary people dont need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply Masks dont replace hand washing and social distancing

How do I get tested
If youre sick and you think youve been exposed to the new coronavirus the CDC recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears They will decide if you need to be tested Keep in mind that theres a chance  because of a lack of testing kits or because youre asymptomatic for instance  you wont be able to get tested

How does coronavirus spread
It seems to spread very easily from person to person especially in homes hospitals and other confined spaces The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face

Is there a vaccine yet
No Clinical trials are underway in the United States China and Europe But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least  to  months away

What makes this outbreak so different
Unlike the flu there is no known treatment or vaccine and little is known about this particular virus so far It seems to be more lethal than the flu but the numbers are still uncertain And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions  not just those with respiratory diseases  particularly hard

What if somebody in my family gets sick
If the family member doesnt need hospitalization and can be cared for at home you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms while also keeping as much distance as possible according to guidelines issued by the CDC If theres space the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom If masks are available both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters doorknobs toilets and tables Dont forget to wash your hands frequently

Should I stock up on groceries
Plan two weeks of meals if possible But people should not hoard food or supplies Despite the empty shelves the supply chain remains strong And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home

Can I go to the park
Yes but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who dont live in your home Even if you just hang out in a park rather than go for a jog or a walk getting some fresh air and hopefully sunshine is a good idea

Should I pull my money from the markets
Thats not a good idea Even if youre retired having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation or even grows makes sense But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a years worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years

What should I do with my k
Watching your balance go up and down can be scary You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions  dont If your employer matches any part of your contributions make sure youre at least saving as much as you can to get that free money
